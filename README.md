## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€˜m Jun Tian. Currently, I am a junior visiting student in University of California, Berkeley. And My home university is University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. I am always passionate about computer vision. To be more specific, I am currently very interested in the multi-modal field, especially the combination of text and vision problem. What's more, I have also been interested in the field of robotics recently. 

Feel free to reach out and connect if there is a project or postion that you think I would be suitable for, or if you just want to say hi.
